## About the project

This is my <strong>7<sup>th</sup></strong> Frontend Mentor challenge.

This is my solution to the Todo app with color theme switcher challenge on Frontend Mentor. The goal of this challenge is to build a Todo application with React library and to use some of the advanced state management techniques such as useReducer and Context API.

Users should be able to:

- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode
- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## Built with

For this project i used:

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- React
- Vite
